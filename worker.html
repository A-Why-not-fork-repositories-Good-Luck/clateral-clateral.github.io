                                I have worked within the BMW Group, which is one of the world's leading car manufacturers. I worked as an advisor and was usually the "spider in the web" between the various departments. Great focus was prioritized on ensuring that the customers were always satisfied and that they received the right help. There was a lot of back office work such as order processing, warranty matters and calls. The company has taught me that success is based on long-term thinking combined with responsible decision-making.

                                I mainly worked as a host, which means I was responsible for all customers who came into the company. After the welcome and the dialogue, I directed the customer to the requested car model, told all conceivable information about the car's unique features and also offered an expectant test drive.This is an important part of the sales process because the first impression usually determines whether the customer will want to buy the car in the end. In sales support, I also helped to present prices to customers and I always tried to find the best solution.
